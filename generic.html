								<p>It was 2013 and I had just graduated from high school. I remember not making a big deal about it.
									I thought to myself, "The easy part is done. Now comes the hard part - the real world." I'd be lying if I said I wasn't 
									slightly worried about getting out there. I mean I felt pretty out of place at school so of course it would've been hard to think positive about the outcome.
									At the time I felt like education should be the next course of action. My mother had implanted the idea that I HAD to get a college degree. I didn't want
									to disappoint my parent's expectations and signed up for classes at Lone Star College. I selected a few classes because I didn't want to 
									overload myself and made a schedule that I could do routinely along side with my workout.
									</p>
								<p>
									Now it's 2014, my bod looking hotter, and I was still taking college classes but, I didn't want my parents to pay for my classes. I had to find a way to pay for my own things.
									My brother had been working at a metal factory for a while and he offered to get me a job. I quickly accepted his offer and soon enough I started working at Park USA, a metal fabrication company that 
									supplies other companies with break tanks or water tanks. Their frequent buyers were hospitals, schools, and office bulidings. I come from a family of hard workers so I wanted to make a 
									strong impression to everyone that I was one too. It was a bit challenging adapting to a new environment after all is was my first job ever but, soon enough I could stand on my own. It was a difficult 5 years but afterwards 
									I learned how to run 3 big machines, operator both a crane and forklift, understand the ecosystem of the job, and how to communicate effectively. 
								</p>
								<p>
									2019 is here and I felt as if I had learned all I could at Park. I felt like I could be doing more but, I didn't know what I could do. In this point in time he had quit working at Park and became a software developer and every so often would show me one of his projects.
									To his amazement, I could understand and pick up code without having any prior knowledge. In my head it didn't seem like a big deal but, afterwards the more I would think about what a certain method would do, I would always ask him questions. Before long I grew 
									more and more curious about how programing works and what kind of coding languages there are. It absolutly blew my mind when I found out how much work and information goes into something as simple as a receipt, it's amazing! While I was working I decided that I would pursue coding
									whenever and however I could like before, here comes my brother. He started he's new job at Flatiron School a 15 week bootcamp course where they teach students the core basics of coding as well as what modren companies are looking for. It sounded perfect, I took a chance, quit my job, and within 1 week
									I was a student at Flatiron. 15 weeks painfully beauitful weeks later, I graduated and now I am ready to show what I got! I absolutly love what I do and how I can help others as well!
